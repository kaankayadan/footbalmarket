# Architecture Guide for Football Prediction Market

## 1. Overview

This project is a football prediction market platform built with Next.js. It currently uses:
- **NextAuth** for authentication (email/password via CredentialsProvider)
- **Prisma ORM** for database interactions (with an existing SQLite database as a starting point)
- **shadcn/ui components** and **Tailwind CSS** for the UI
- **Mock data** is used for markets, trades, and transactions (to be replaced with live API endpoints)

## 2. Current Implementation

- **User Authentication:**  
  Handled via NextAuth with email and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and sessions leverage JWT.

- **Market Management:**  
  Market creation, display, and trade functionalities are provided via dedicated pages. Currently, mock data is used, but API routes exist for future integration.

- **UI Components:**  
  The interface is built with modular components including Navbar, Forms (using React Hook Form and Zod for validation), Cards, Toast notifications (custom use-toast hook), and more.

## 3. Proposed Enhancements

### API Integration & Data Management
- **Replace Mock Data with Live Data:**  
  - Create API endpoints for:
    - **Markets** (create, list, details)
    - **Trades** (execute trade, update trade history)
    - **Transactions** (deposit, withdrawal, balance tracking)
  - Use Prisma client in the endpoints to interact with the database.

### Security Improvements
- **Enhanced Input Validation:**  
  Extend validation on both frontend and backend.
- **Authorization Middleware:**  
  Protect API routes and enforce access control.
- **Sensitive Data Handling:**  
  Ensure secure management of passwords and tokens.

### UI & User Experience
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:**  
  Replace static mock data with live data fetched from API endpoints.
- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  Consider implementing WebSocket or long-polling to update markets and trades in real time.
- **Pagination:**  
  Implement pagination for market listings and trade histories to improve scalability and performance.

### Optional Enhancements
- **Admin Panel:**  
  Develop an admin interface for overseeing market resolutions and user management.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Use React optimizations (e.g., React.memo, useCallback) to improve component performance.

## 4. Proposed File Structure Enhancements

- **API Directory:**  
  Create or update the following endpoints:
  - `/src/app/api/markets` – for market-related CRUD operations
  - `/src/app/api/trades` – for executing and tracking trades
  - `/src/app/api/transactions` – for managing deposits and withdrawals

- **Guidance Document:**  
  This file, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, serves as a roadmap for iterative improvements and can be updated as the project evolves.

## 6. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

1. **API Endpoints Setup:**
   - Create endpoints for markets, trades, and transactions.
   - Use Prisma in these endpoints to perform database operations.
   - Ensure endpoints include proper validation and error handling.

2. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Update pages to fetch data from the newly created API endpoints.
   - Replace mock data with live data while maintaining proper loading and error states.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement middleware to protect API routes.
   - Strengthen input validation and error management across the application.

4. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Add pagination for lists to enhance performance.
   - Consider implementing real-time updates for trades.
   - Review and refine global components (e.g., Navbar).

5. **Optional Features:**
   - Design and integrate an admin panel for market resolutions and user management.
   - Investigate real-time update systems (WebSockets).

6. **Testing & Deployment:**
   - Thoroughly test each API endpoint and UI component.
   - Optimize for performance and security.
   - Deploy and monitor the application with iterative updates based on feedback.

## 7. Conclusion

This guide provides a clear roadmap for transforming the current prototype into a robust, production-ready football prediction market platform. It outlines enhancements for data management, security, UI improvements, and optional real-time features. Following these steps will enable systematic progress toward a fully functional and scalable platform.
